# cppc  (an abbreviation for cpp course)

Slides and example programs for new C++ course at NTNU, using the PPP book by Bjarne Stroustrup. The course uses FLTK/PPP graphics and GUI elements. All here is under development, course starts 7. January 2019.

- folder lec1, lec2 etc. is short for Lecture 1, Lecture 2 and so on. Each such folder stores a PDF of the latest 
version of the slides used in that lecture along with some or all of the example code shown in that lecture.

- it is only the sourcefiles in the example lectured, or demonstrated in the lecture that is stored in this repo. Users must use their own C++ setup (Windows, Max, Linux, ...) to run the examples. We give some simple help for MS-VS just below, and will provide something similar for Mac soon. The example programs should run on all platforms.

- the ZIP-file PPP_FLTK_base.zip gives an easy way to install PPP w/FLTK under Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017. We run version 15.8.8. Unzipped, the project compiles example program Lec2Ex1c.cpp. For a new example program with graphics, just make a new copy, unzip, and replace the source files. We are aware of this being a somewhat clumsy,  very brute force way of making a new example program to run, but it is chosen here now for maximum simplicity.

- comments are appreciated, and should be e-mailed to xxx@computer.org, where xxx is replaced with my first name
