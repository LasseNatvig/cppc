# cppc  (an abbreviation for cpp course)

Slides and example programs for new C++ course at NTNU, using the PPP book by Bjarne Stroustrup. The course uses FLTK/PPP graphics and GUI elements. All here is under development, course starts 7. January.

- folder lec1, lec2 etc. is short for Lecture 1, Lecture 2 and so on. Each such folder stores a PDF of the latest 
version of the slides used in that lecture along with some or all of the example code shown in that lecture.

- the ZIP-file PPP_FLTK_base.zip gives an easy way to install PPP w/FLTK under Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017. We run version 15.8.8. Unzipped, the project compiles example program Lec2Ex1c.cpp. For a new example program with graphics, just make a new copy, unzip, and replace the source files. We are aware of this being a very brute force way of makeing an ew example program to run, but it is chosen here noew for maximum simplicity.

- everything here is very preliminary, for testing the integration of github, MS Visual Studio and 
Blackboard (The electronic learning management system used in all courses at NTNU).

- comments are appreciated, and should be e-mailed to xxx@computer.org, where xxx is replaced with my first name
