# cppc  (an abbreviation for cpp course)

## This repository was closed December 2019

**the example programs used in the spring 2020 edition of the course are posted at github.com/LasseNatvig/cppc2020.git**

Example programs for the new C++ course at NTNU were posted here during spring 2019. The course used the PPP book by Bjarne Stroustrup. The course uses FLTK/PPP graphics and GUI elements.

The files are now available as a ZIP-file only. It is important that students in the spring 2020 course only use the repository mentioned above.

The 2019 files:

- folder lec1, lec2 etc. is short for Lecture 1, Lecture 2 and so on. Each such folder stores some or all of the example code shown in that lecture.

- it is only the source files in the example lectured, or demonstrated in the lecture that is stored in this repo. Users must use their own C++ setup (Windows, Max, Linux, ...) to run the examples.

- comments are appreciated, and should be e-mailed to xxx@computer.org, where xxx is replaced with my first name
